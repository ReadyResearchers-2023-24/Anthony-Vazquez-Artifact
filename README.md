# Anthony-Vazquez-Artifact


* In this document I will be going over the basis of my idea for my artifact, and the sorts of work, research, and development it will take   to complete this project. This will include but not be limited to: my motivation/reason for completing this project, different works or     studies that may be closely related to mine, any details that pertain to my work for this artifact, and my plans for this project in the    future.


## What is my Artifact?

* I wanted to create something where I could help people further understand their impact on not only their immediate environment in their     surrounding community, and possibly also on a national, or even global scale if possible.
  
  - The general population doesn't always know the direct impact that they may be having on the environment through the things that they       use every day, and further so, they don't always understand the amount of a carbon footprint they are leaving, or really even the extent    of what type of energy they are using and how its being produced.
  - We use energy and technology every day but do we really understand how it works and what makes it work? Understanding what goes into       the things we utilize on a daily basis and giving a visual of what that leads to for your carbon footprint over time may help to make       people more conscious about the things they do each day, and even down to the products they may use.
  - Starting anywhere helps the end goal of environmental betterment, if we can get people to understand how they impact the environment       that gets the world one step closer to creating a better place for the future civilizations to thrive. I believe one of the biggest         problems with the longterm climate change debates is the knowledge gap that exists between the experts and the general population, in       order to believe in something they must know that it is true and understand how they factor into the situation.

* It would have the ability to show a person how their community contributes to the overall carbon footprint of their city, county, or        state and what types of services are the biggest contributing factors to that.
  
  - I would like to add functionality where the user can interact with a map of either the united states, their state, their county, or        their city. The data provided at each of these levels would be the carbon footprint that area has on the county, state, or country, and     what the major types of energy use and services are being used there. The types of energy that are available in an area is directly         correlated to the type and the amount of pollution that is output.
  - Later functionality might even be links to services or products that help combat the pollution output. Possibly even adding a personal     section where the people are able to add in their information and what types of appliances they use/how much they use them, and then        providing them with a report on what their carbon footprint is and how it is compared to others in their area.

* If people had the ability to change for the betterment of themselves or the community around them, why wouldn't they?
